# Optimizing_Model_Performance_with_Penalized_Regression_Techniques
Explore advanced regression analysis with this deep dive into penalized regression techniques, including Lasso and Ridge. This project showcases model optimization, tackling overfitting, and improving prediction accuracy in Python.

# Overview
This repository demonstrates the application of penalized regression techniques, including Lasso (L1 regularization) and Ridge (L2 regularization), using Python. It focuses on minimizing overfitting and enhancing the prediction accuracy of regression models through the introduction of penalties on the size of coefficients.

# Setup
## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- pip or conda

# Dependencies
##   To get started, install the necessary libraries:
- pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib

# Data
The notebook utilizes synthetic or real-world datasets to illustrate the effectiveness of penalized regression techniques in handling multicollinearity and overfitting.

# Features
- Introduction to penalized regression concepts.
- Implementation of Lasso and Ridge regression models.
- Comparison of model performance with standard regression to highlight the benefits of regularization.
- Model tuning with hyperparameter optimization for optimal regularization strength.
